# Intro to Quantitative Trading | Finance and Analytics Club | IIT Kanpur

## Project Overview

This project, conducted from May ’23 to Jul ’23 as part of the Finance and Analytics Club at IIT Kanpur, involves implementing various quantitative trading strategies using Python. The strategies include golden cross, death cross, mean reversion, and pairs trading. The project also includes the development of a dynamic trailing stop loss mechanism to improve risk management and capital preservation. Extensive backtesting of these strategies was performed using Blueshift, with thorough performance analysis and optimization.

## Trading Strategies

### Golden Cross

The golden cross strategy involves using two moving averages, typically the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. A buy signal is generated when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average.

### Death Cross

The death cross strategy is the opposite of the golden cross. It uses the same moving averages, and a sell signal is generated when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average.

### Mean Reversion

The mean reversion strategy is based on the principle that asset prices tend to revert to their historical mean. This strategy involves buying undervalued assets and selling overvalued ones.

### Pairs Trading

Pairs trading involves identifying two highly correlated assets. When the price ratio of these assets diverges from its historical mean, a long position is taken in the undervalued asset and a short position in the overvalued asset.

## Dynamic Trailing Stop Loss

A dynamic trailing stop loss mechanism was developed to improve risk management and capital preservation. This mechanism adjusts the stop loss level dynamically based on market conditions and the performance of the trading strategy.

## Backtesting

The strategies were extensively backtested using Blueshift, a cloud-based backtesting platform. The backtesting process involved running the strategies on historical data to evaluate their performance and make necessary adjustments.

## Performance Analysis and Optimization

Thorough performance analysis was conducted on the backtested results to identify strengths and weaknesses of each strategy. Optimization techniques were applied to enhance the overall performance and profitability.
